Hi. I'm an experimental Theme named Jasper.
I'm currently in development.

My aim is to implement Backbone / Underscore & Require into a Wordpress theme.

Jaspers currently dependant on the ACF $ JSON API Plugins.

Will possibley look to jettison ACF and replace the JSON API Plugin with Wordpress's Jetpack.
